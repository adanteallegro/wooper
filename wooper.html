             <ul>
                <li>Gold: This Pokémon lives in cold water. It will leave the water to search for food when it gets cold outside. </li>
                <li>Silver: When it walks around on the ground, it coats its body with a slimy, poisonous film. </li>
                <li>Crystal: A mucous membrane covers its body. Touching it barehanded will cause a shooting pain. </li>
                <li>Ruby/Sapphire: Wooper usually lives in water. However, it occasionally comes out onto land in search of food. On land, it coats its body with a gooey, toxic film. </li>
                <li>Emerald: Wooper usually live in water but come out onto land seeking food occasionally. On land, they coat their bodies with a gooey, toxic film. </li>
                <li>Diamond: It lives in cold water, half burying itself in mud at the bottom to sleep. </li>
                <li>Pearl: When the temperature cools in the evening, they emerge from water to seek food along the shore. </li>
                <li>Platinum: When walking on land, it covers its body with a poisonous film that keeps its skin from dehydrating.</li>
                <li>Scarlet: A transparent mucous membrane covers its body. Touching it bare-handed will cause a tingling numbness.</li>
                <li>New Pokemon Snap: Wooper is very timid and tends to stick close to Quagsire. Its body is also coated in a poisonous goo. Whatever you do, don’t touch it, or else your hand will really sting!</li>
                <li>Pokemon Sleep: Wooper usually lives in water and has a habit of burying half its body in the mud at the bottom of the water to sleep. When it sleeps on land, it buries itself in mud to keep its skin from dehydrating. </li>
             </ul>
             <p>Paldean Wooper Entries</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Scarlet: After losing a territorial struggle, Wooper began living on land. The Pokémon changed over time, developing a poisonous film to protect its body. </li>
                <li>Violet: It's dangerous for Wooper to travel alone. They line up in groups of three or four and help each other as they walk around the wetlands. </li>
