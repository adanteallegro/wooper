             <ul>
                <li>Gold: This Pokémon lives in cold water. It will leave the water to search for food when it gets cold outside. </li>
                <li>Silver: When it walks around on the ground, it coats its body with a slimy, poisonous film. </li>
                <li>Crystal: A mucous membrane covers its body. Touching it barehanded will cause a shooting pain. </li>
                <li>Ruby/Sapphire: Wooper usually lives in water. However, it occasionally comes out onto land in search of food. On land, it coats its body with a gooey, toxic film. </li>
                <li>Emerald: Wooper usually live in water but come out onto land seeking food occasionally. On land, they coat their bodies with a gooey, toxic film. </li>
                <li>Diamond: It lives in cold water, half burying itself in mud at the bottom to sleep. </li>
                <li>Pearl: When the temperature cools in the evening, they emerge from water to seek food along the shore. </li>
                <li>Platinum: When walking on land, it covers its body with a poisonous film that keeps its skin from dehydrating.</li>
                <li>Scarlet: A transparent mucous membrane covers its body. Touching it bare-handed will cause a tingling numbness.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Paldean Wooper Entries</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Scarlet: After losing a territorial struggle, Wooper began living on land. The Pokémon changed over time, developing a poisonous film to protect its body. </li>
                <li>Violet: It's dangerous for Wooper to travel alone. They line up in groups of three or four and help each other as they walk around the wetlands. </li>
